	<p>In Super Smash Brothers, Link is the 3rd character added in a series with more than 70 iconic characters! In this game, Link wears the champions tunic from the Legend of Zelda Breath of the WIld. Link carries his trusted Master Sword  and defends himself with the almighty Hylian Shield! He also carries a bow and arrow, a remote bomb that can be detonated and a boomerang! When things get really heated, he pulls out his Ancient Arrow and uses it to either vaporize or blast his foes away!
